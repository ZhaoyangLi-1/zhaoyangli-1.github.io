Hello! I am a Research Assistant at [USC](https://www.usc.edu/), fortunate to be advised by [Erdem Biyik](https://ebiyik.github.io/). Previously, I completed my Master’s in [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.ucsd.edu/) at [UC San Diego](https://www.ucsd.edu/), where I worked with [Hao Su](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~haosu/) and [Pengtao Xie](https://pengtaoxie.github.io/). I also earned a double major Bachelor’s degree in [Computer Science](https://guide.wisc.edu/undergraduate/letters-science/computer-sciences/computer-sciences-bs/) and [Mathematics](https://guide.wisc.edu/undergraduate/letters-science/mathematics/mathematics-ba/mathematics-mathematics-data-science-ba/#text) from [UW–Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/), where I worked with [Vikas Singh](https://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~vsingh/).


My research focuses on developing embodied agents that can perceive, reason, and act in the physical world. I work at the intersection of **multimodal learning**, **robot learning**, and **preference alignment**. Broadly, I am interested in:

- **Vision–Language Models:** Enhancing the robustness of large vision–language models, with a focus on improving their physical grounding in real-world environments and their applications.
- **Efficient Control and Planning:** Developing effective policies through imitation learning, reinforcement learning, and diffusion-based generative methods.
- **Vision–Language–Action (VLA) Integration:** Integrating vision–language–action systems into unified embodied agents 
- **Human-centered Alignment:** Grounding agents’ behaviors in human intentions using feedback, pairwise preferences, and other weak supervision.

Ultimately, my goal is to build interpretable, reliable, and safe embodied agents that generalize beyond curated demonstrations and operate effectively in open-world environments.


🚀 I am currently applying for PhD programs for Fall 2026. You can see my [CV](/files/Zhaoyang_Li_CV.pdf).
